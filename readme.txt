Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is free software distributed under the GPL.
Git has a mutable index called stage.
Git tracks changes.

Git can do so many things that you won't forget what you have done in the past.
Maybe it is better to write readme doc in a .md file. Just google markdown. :)
